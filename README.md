This is the code I used to generate the images for [City Placement](https://interestingthings.museum/puzzles/city-placement) in the 2023 MIT Mystery Hunt.

It contains **spoilers** for the puzzle, so read at your own risk! The code is somewhat hacky given the nature of writing and rewriting a puzzle, but hopefully it is a useful resource if someone wants to create similar maps.
